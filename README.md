# HOW TO COMPLETE
To complete the game, after clearing all the enemies in the combat zones, the special reward for the area must be added to the player's inventory. If the player collects all the rewards and returns to the "Safe House," they win the game. Additionally, the player cannot re-enter a zone where the reward has been collected.
